### Introduction

We have already packaged the CBC solver into the third_party directory, so you don't need to install the CBC solver yourself. The code currently only supports Linux operating system and requires Cmake and GCC. It is not compatible with other operating systems at the moment.

### Complie

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

### Run

```
./cbc_demo
```
